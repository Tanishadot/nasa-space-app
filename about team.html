            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>At Hackie Chan, we don’t just code; we create magic (with a hint of chaos). Our motto? Our mission? To create interstellar solutions that even NASA would applaud.</p>
            <p>Fueled by coffee, pizza, and our collective love for breaking things—until they work! We believe in teamwork, creativity, and the occasional dance-off during debugging sessions.</p>
            <p>Our secret weapon? A shared sense of humor that keeps our spirits high and our code flowing. Whether it's conquering a complex algorithm or tackling a late-night code crisis, we’re always ready to tackle the challenge with a grin!</p>
            <p>Join us on our quest for hackathon glory—where the only bugs we fear are the ones that fly!</p>
